# GenesisMC
<h4>Bringing custom origins to PaperMC.</h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>GenesisMC is an unofficial port of the Origins Mod to PaperMC servers. Over the course of 1 1/2 years of development, Genesis has come a long way from where it started, now supporting a large majority of custom origins, improving in every single commit. In the latest 1.0.0 beta versions avalible on the discord server or the github repository, it even adds support for custom origins that require Pehuki! Best of all, its compatible with Geyser/Bedrock clients, and requires no mods or resource packs to be downloaded to play! If you need any support for the plugin please feel free to join our discord server and ping me(@dueris) anytime for help.</p>
<p align="left">Genesis is in NO WAY affiliated with the Origins Mod for Fabric. All issues should be reported to the github repo for Genesis, not Origins. Any inconsistencies from the Origins mod and Genesis should be reported to Genesis aswell.</p>
<p align="left">Genesis is built on Paper, so Spigot/CraftBukkit servers will not work, and I dont have plans to make it supported. Please pay attention to the version Genesis works on when downloading. Genesis is HIGHLY version dependant and will not load on any other server version than the one its made for.</p>
<h2 align="left"><strong font-size="202px">Going forward</strong></h2>
<p align="left">With custom origins being nearly completed, Genesis is thinking about expanding the custom origins support it currently has. From Pehuki, to other mods, Genesis is going to attempt to include as much custom origins support as possible, so any origin can be played.</p>
<h2 align="left"><strong font-size="202px">Donate</strong></h2>
<p align="left">If you like the plugin and want to support me, consider donating! I have put thousands of hours and millions of lines of code into this project and it would help me greatly if you donated.</p>
