# GenesisMC

#### Bringing custom origins to PaperMC.

GenesisMC is an unofficial port of the Origins Mod to PaperMC servers. Over the course of 1 1/2 years of development,
Genesis has come a long way from where it started, now supporting most custom origins from the original mod. Best of
all, its compatible with Geyser/Bedrock clients, and requires no mods or resource packs to be downloaded to play!

## Important Notice

Genesis is in NO WAY affiliated with the Origins Mod for Fabric. All issues should be reported to the GitHub repository
for Genesis, not Origins. Any inconsistencies from the Origins mod and Genesis should be reported to Genesis as well.
Genesis is built on Paper, so Spigot/CraftBukkit servers will not work, and I don't have plans to make it supported.
Please pay attention to the version Genesis works on when downloading. Genesis is **HIGHLY** version dependant and will
not load on any other server version than the one its made for.

## How do I add custom origins?

It's as simple as dragging and dropping the zip file into the datapacks folder of the overworld, and restarting your
server. As of v1.0.0, most custom origins should work perfectly fine! If you encounter any issues please report it to
the GitHub repository or the discord server.

## Going forward

With custom origins being nearly completed, Genesis is thinking about expanding the scope of custom origins support.
From Pehuki, to other mods, Genesis will attempt to include as much custom origins support as possible, so any origin
can be played.

## Donate

If you like the plugin and want to support me, consider donating! I have put thousands of hours and millions of lines of
code into this project, and it would help me greatly if you donated.
